I'd like to know if there is a feature to set different actions (or the same action twice) when a button is pressed and released.
For example, I'd like to trigger XF86AudioMute on press (to mute) AND on release (to unmute). If this feature isn't there yet it 
would be nice to have (if possible).

Maybe the press action is held before the button is released. And on button release, a quick tap is triggered for the release action.
