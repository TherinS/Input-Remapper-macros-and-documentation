===== To make a mouse button held down macro

Your key would be stuck in autorepeat forever. It would be like keeping your
 finger on your "a" key on your keyboard. If you disabled the release of your
 left mouse button and tried to drag a file, it would never let go of the file.

Yes you can do that with:

    e(EV_KEY, BTN_LEFT, 1) 

Change BTN_LEFT to KEY_A, or whatever key you are mapping this to,
 but that basically completely breaks that key UNLESS you set another key to
stop the macro from running: 

Map:

    e(EV_KEY, BTN_LEFT, 0) 

to another key to cause key release.

In sudo evtest you can observe the injections by key-mapper. h(k(BTN_MOUSE))
 seems to behave like h(BTN_MOUSE) on my computer as well, but when looking
 into evtest you can see that it actually is injecting a lot of clicks. So
 the environment seems to do some magic there, probably because the events
 are injected so fast.

 This is so you can repeat a button when you hold down another key, like when
a action requires a click each time you want to perform the action.

    say, spam(BTN_MOUSE,500)) with 500 being the interval

try: h(k(BTN_MOUSE).w(500))
